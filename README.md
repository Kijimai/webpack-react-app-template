# React with Webpack

## What is this?

This is a template for a react app that is built upon webpack without the use of create-react-app and its preinstalled packages.

## Included:

- An SCSS styles folder containing two other folders (abstracts | base)
  - The abstracts folder contains a variables.scss file with two css variables intialized for the colors black and white
  - The base folder contains the base.scss file that has basic css resets with the box-sizing set to border-box
- A complementary goobbue image <br>
  <img src="./src/assets/goob.png" width="200" style="display: block;"/>
